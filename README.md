# Minimal-Api-.Net
## Bookstore

- Here in this project, we are going to create a minimal API using .Net 9.0. 
- We are going to create a bookstore api
- The article I used to create this project is [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-minimal-api-in-net-core-handbook/)

**The best way to learn is by doing it yourself, so I recommend you to follow the article and create the project on your own machine.**
